 * In a real-world application, this function would make an API call to a backend service

 * 
 * 1. Send the LinkedIn URL to a backend endpoint
 * 2. The backend would use appropriate tools like Puppeteer, Playwright, or a scraping service
 * 3. The backend would handle authentication, session management, and proxy rotation if needed
 * 4. The scraped data would be processed, cleaned, and structured
 * 5. The results would be returned to the client
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Web scraping may violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service. A proper implementation should:
 * - Respect robots.txt
 * - Include appropriate rate limiting
 * - Consider using LinkedIn's official API for permitted data access
 * - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
